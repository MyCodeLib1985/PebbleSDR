Todo List
_ Investigate SoapySDR for device driver compatibility
_ Investigate SDR-J for decoder compatibility
_ Bug: wav playback doesn't work with QTAudio
_ Investigate Liquid-DSP DSP library for compatibility
_ Revisit zoom logic so it doesn't change every click.  Maybe just lock to LO frequency?
_ Revisit tuning increments.  Select digit on freq display, that's the new units for coarse and fine tuning.
    Pre-select other common fixed tuning increments
_ Add spectrum offset back and check to make sure signal strength doesn't change when we change
    full scale db and offset
_ SDR Play hangs at high sample rates
