BUGS

_ Bug: qt.conf already exists warning.  Occurs if Pebble.app already exists when we build
_ Bug: Try using OSX USB first before D2XX to avoid driver conflict
_ Bug: No Display doesn't collapse hidden frames any more.  Cosmetic
_ Bug: HPSDR has not been tested or firmware updated in a long time.  Test Ozzy and Mettis
_ Bug: Check FunCube dongle device settings.  Seems dead when tested 12/30/15
_ Bug: Unplugging FCD while Pebble is open (not running) crashes in hid-mac.c
_ Bug: Can't debug main Pebble application.  Libraries and plugins are ok.  I think there may be a problem
    with all the fixups we do during install

FEATURES
_ Hi-res spectrum has slightly lower signal strength than unprocessed spectrum.  Losing gain in downConvert?
    We need to normalize.\
_ IQ correction (based on signals above median noise)
_ Freq correction for devices that support it (like FCD) in ppm

_ Revisit tuning increments.  Select digit on freq display, that's the new units for coarse and fine tuning.
    Pre-select other common fixed tuning increments
_ Calibrate all devices by injecting known signal and adjust normalizeIQ Gain
_ RTL2832 ADSB decoder plugin
_ RTL2832 read whatever is there each thread slice and don't wait for full buffer with read_sync.

_ Add peak option to spectrum display

_ Fifi: Add fifi specific device options to form
_ Fifi: Add support for Fifi built in demod (Fifi-SDR AM/FM/SSB Receiver) audio device

_ ACARS (118-136mhz) aircraft decoder
_ Direct tuning mode for RTL2832 and other.  LO and mixer are internal, user just sees frequency
_ Add auto to FS and Base dB.  Uses median noise to set base level and peak signal to set FS db.
_ Move spectrum cursor tracking to display next to cursor instead of fixed label
_ Scan mode.  Builds special memory file scan.csv

_ KX3 Slave mode: Track freq from KX3, IQ out to audio for basic spectrum.  Advanced, click on spectrum
    to adjust KX3.  Maybe full remote mode?  Open QT Serial connection at 38400 and set terminal commands.
_ AirSpy when I get repaired unit back
_ Elad FDM S2
_ HackRF

_ Higher res FFT option, 4096 etc?

INTERNAL
_ Pick coding standard and update everything
_ Clean up SpectrumWidget / ReceiverWidget / Receiver logic.  Widgets should just handle UI (View) and send
    signals that Reciever (Model) (and any other interested class) can connect to.  In this mode, Receiver knows about
    widgets, but widgets don't have to know about Receiver

INVESTIGATE
_ Investigate DSDPlus www.dsdplus.com for police, fire, etc decoders https://github.com/szechyjs/dsd
_ Investigate SDS-B http://www.rtl-sdr.com/adsb-aircraft-radar-with-rtl-sdr/
_ Investigate Codec2 voice compression http://www.rowetel.com/
_ Investigate Liquid-DSP DSP library for compatibility
_ Investigate SoapySDR for device driver compatibility
_ Investigate SDR-J for decoder compatibility
